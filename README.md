paper title: DGSD: Distributed Graph Representation via Graph Statistical Properties - the paper is currently under review in FGCS <br />

The following libararies should be installed to run the code

Networkx
grakel
sklearn
multiprocessing

The code automatically download datasets from Grakel website therefore the system must be connected with internet. For downloding the datasets manually,follow this link: https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets

run the code 

python python-DGSD_main.py

The implementation in C language is also provided that can be run in distributed envrironment on very large graphs.
